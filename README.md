# GameOfLife

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.[1] It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.....

When main.py is run, a random pattern is created. Press the green button to start/run the simulation and red button to pause/stop the simulation.
Thank you.

To Do:
code a method to add custom pattern to simulation
